# reverse-chat-test-task
Type your name (a-z) and click button to start the chat. 
You will see greeting in chat widget with the name you've typed previously.
After that send any message and get the reverse one from chat bot. 
You can't send exactly the same message 2 times.
If you try to send the same message, you will see "Sorry, you've already asked that question"

In version 1.2 were fixed and added:
    1) now in chat window you see your name instead of "You";
    2) now "comparing function" blocks messages sended only by you, not the bot's messages (you can send 'hello' and next 'olleh').
    3) case sensitivity, now it doesn't matter lower or upper case letters in your message - you won't be able to send the same mwssage 2 times;
